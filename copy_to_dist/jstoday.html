  One of the most difficult things for me is keeping up with trends in front-end development.  Every week I read about some new library,
  framework or method that 'everyone' seems to be using already.  In an effort to stay closer to new technologies, conference talks,
  etc, I created <a href="http://jspro.io">JsToday</a>.  This is a simple web app running on a node.js server.  It gathers the lastest
  tweets and blog posts from the most important thought leaders using front-end technologies.

  My biggest challenge in creating this site was integrating Oauth user flows for Google, Facebook, Github, as well as local login.
   However, I emerged from this project with an excellent boilerplate, which I have since used in creating other node based web apps.
   I use JsToday every day to keep up with trends, and to star articles discussing new technologies that I want to do more research on.
