  In 2016, after many months of building an owning a tool called <a href="//adbuilder.yieldmo.com/">Ad Builder</a>, I began running the entire Applications team at <a href="http://yieldmo.com">Yieldmo</a>.  In this role my objective was to take a vast and disparate set of tools and consolidate them into one cohesive platform.
</p>

<p>
  The Applications team was made up of 13 Engineers, Designers and Product folks.  We delivered several inidividual projects under the overall initiative of cleaning up our set of internal and external tools.
</p>

<p>
  On the Engineering side, we established an entirely new service/back-end architecture for our applications. We cleared up an enourmous amount of tech debt and organized to get the most out of our team, allowing us to support the existing tools while building the next generation of Applications.
</p>

<p>
  We were also able to develop a set of packages and libraries to make life easier on the front end.  These packages distributed versioned data, brand elements, and function UI components to any Application via NPM or Bower.
</p>

<p>
  On the Design side, we were able to completely rethink our core external Applications.  The team resdesigned our blog, our website, our component libraries, as well as many other applications.
